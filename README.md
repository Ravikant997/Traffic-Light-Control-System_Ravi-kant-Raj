           Introduction
The Traffic Light Control System is a simple program that simulates the functioning of a real-world traffic light using a Python console. It follows a cyclic sequence of Green, Yellow, and Red lights, each having a specific duration. This program can be used for traffic simulations, educational purposes, or as a foundation for more advanced traffic management systems.

 
         Methodology

The system follows a step-by-step approach to ensure smooth execution:

Step 1: Problem Definition
•	The goal is to mimic a traffic light system using Python.
•	The system should cycle through Green, Yellow, and Red lights continuously.
•	Each light should be displayed for a fixed duration.

Step 2: Design & Planning
•	Sequence of lights: Green → Yellow → Red → Repeat.
•	Time duration for each light: 
o	Green Light: 5 seconds (Vehicles can move).
o	Yellow Light: 2 seconds (Warning to slow down).
o	Red Light: 5 seconds (Vehicles must stop).

Step 3: Implementation Using Python
•	Use time.sleep() to introduce delays and control light duration.
•	Use an infinite loop (while True) to keep the system running continuously.

Step 4: Testing & Debugging
•	Verify that the output correctly follows the Green → Yellow → Red sequence.
•	Ensure timing is accurate for each signal.

Step 5: Future Enhancements
•	Graphical Interface (GUI) using Tkinter/ Pygame.
•	AI-based smart traffic control to adjust light duration based on traffic density.
•	IoT-based real-world implementation using Raspberry Pi and sensors.
